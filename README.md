thanks to girls got game game jam for hosting the game jam

## What is it?
A rpg game

It can be played on [itch.io](https://fossilkeeper24.itch.io/the-quest-to-the-queen)

## Synopsis
Princess Selene of Blue Moon is deeply entranced by Queen Ophelia of the Rose Paradise and desires to sway the Queen to be in love with her however when Seleneâ€™s gift of a rose gold locket gets stolen by an evil witch, Princess Selene must defeat the fallen women of the Rose Paradise to reach the Queen.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by various dating simulators and rpg games such as "date everything" and "stardew valley".

## What it does
The player plays as Princess Selene and journeys through the kingdom of Rose Paradise and interacts with characters through a pre-written story.

## How we built it
We used godot as the game engine to create our game with. Krita was the platform that we mainly used for the art that we created.

## Challenges we ran into
The bugs in the code... they eat up so much time. But they also teach us a lot so it works out in the end!

## What we learnt
We learnt about all the layers that go into developing a game. The art that is needed, the code that needs to be written, the logic of the code.

## FYI - annoying bugs
Bear in mind that when you switch scenes in the game it sends you back to the starting position of the respective scene and also restarts the music so it may be a tad bit annoying.

## Next steps
Fix the bugs... 

Also make the game more interactive by providing alternate storylines to pursue!
