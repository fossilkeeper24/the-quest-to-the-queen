# The Quest to the Queen
Thanks to Girls Got Game game jam for hosting the game jam.

## What is it?
An rpg game with aspects of visual novels.

Made for the Girls Got Game game jam.

It can be played on [itch.io](https://fossilkeeper24.itch.io/the-quest-to-the-queen)

## Synopsis
Princess Selene of Blue Moon is deeply entranced by Queen Ophelia of the Rose Paradise and desires to sway the Queen to be in love with her however when Seleneâ€™s gift of a rose gold locket gets stolen by an evil witch, Princess Selene must defeat the fallen women of the Rose Paradise to reach the Queen.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by various dating simulators and rpg games such as "date everything" and "stardew valley".

## What it does
The player plays as Princess Selene and journeys through the kingdom of Rose Paradise and interacts with characters through a pre-written story.

## How we built it
I used godot as the game engine to create our game with. Krita was the platform that we mainly used for the art that we created.

I did the game developing and my friends made the art and music.

## Challenges we ran into
The bugs in the code... they eat up so much time. But they also teach us a lot so it works out in the end!

One of the annoying ones was the placement of one of the character sprites in the godot editor. I initially thought it was a bug in the code when in reality it was due to the placement of the cross for the reference point of the sprite. It was a simple fix that took me an embarrasing amount of time to realise.

## What we learnt
We learnt about all the layers that go into developing a game. The art that is needed, the code that needs to be written, the logic of the code.

I learnt how to use GDScript and the Godot game engine as a whole to make games. Using Godot to a basic level is now in my skillset.

## FYI - annoying bugs
Bear in mind that when you switch scenes in the game it sends you back to the starting position of the respective scene and also restarts the music so it may be a tad bit annoying. However, they aren't game breaking.

## Next steps
Fix the tiny bugs remaining... 

Also make the game more interactive by providing alternate storylines to pursue!
